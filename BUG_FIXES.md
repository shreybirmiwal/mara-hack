# üêõ Bug Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Scenario Analysis Not Updating Prices ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: When typing scenarios like "hurricane in austin", the system would generate news but not update energy prices or show effects.

**Root Cause**: The scenario analysis endpoint was receiving empty `current_data` from the frontend, so there was no energy data to apply effects to.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `analyze_scenario()` in `backend/server.py` to automatically generate base data when `current_data` is empty
- Added logic: `if not current_data: current_data = get_static_base_data()`

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Before: `"total_affected_locations": 0, "effects_summary": []`  
- ‚úÖ After: `"total_affected_locations": 2, "effects_summary": [...]`

## Issue 2: People Distribution in Weird Streaks ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: The 100 simulated people were appearing in clustered "streaks" rather than being randomly distributed across Texas.

**Root Cause**: People were initialized using their original coordinates from `people.json`, which had some clustering around major cities.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified people initialization in `frontend/src/App.js` to use random coordinates across Texas
- Texas bounds: `lat: 25.8 to 36.5, lng: -106.6 to -93.5`
- Updated both initial load and reset functionality

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Before: People clustered in streaks near major cities
- ‚úÖ After: People randomly distributed across the entire state of Texas

## System Status: ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Backend Server
- ‚úÖ Running on `http://localhost:5001`
- ‚úÖ Energy data generation: 30 locations loaded
- ‚úÖ Scenario analysis: Working with proper effects
- ‚úÖ People reactions: AI-powered responses functional

### Frontend
- ‚úÖ Running on `http://localhost:3000`  
- ‚úÖ 100 people randomly distributed and moving
- ‚úÖ Interactive people popups working
- ‚úÖ Real-time scenario effects on energy prices

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Test energy data
curl http://localhost:5001/api/energy-data

# Test scenario analysis  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/scenario-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenario": "hurricane in austin", "current_data": []}'

# Test people reactions
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/people-reactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenario": "tornado hits Dallas", "people": [...], "affected_locations": []}'
```

## Ready to Use! üöÄ

Your MARA energy map with simulated people is now fully functional:

1. **Watch people**: 100 randomly distributed across Texas, moving and squirming
2. **Run scenarios**: Try "Hurricane hits Houston", "Concert in Austin", etc.
3. **See reactions**: Energy prices update AND people react with AI-generated thoughts
4. **View effects**: Check the news panel for migration updates and price changes

The system is ready for demonstration and testing!
