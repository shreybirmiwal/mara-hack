## p1 simulate how energy prices react
Map of all the energy prices
User enters prompt ‘lets make cloudy’
Weather data
Gpt to write a query in api format
Find when it was actually cloudy get the date and time
Cross reference with energy price then and their
Call gpt again to RAG that data combine with user prompt to create new reality
Display the new simulated changes


## p2: simulate how miners react
above only explains energy price
We need another model for energy price → how miners should react


## p3: simulate how humans react
