A real-time energy pricing visualization tool that combines Texas ERCOT grid data with AI-powered scenario analysis and human behavior simulation.

## What it does
- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes energy prices across Texas with color-coded points and heatmaps
- **AI Scenarios**: Ask "what if" questions (e.g., "What happens if a hurricane hits Houston?") and see how energy prices react
- **People Simulation**: 100 simulated Texans with unique personalities react to events and move around the map
- **Real-time Data**: Live energy pricing from the Texas grid via GridStatus API


Built with React, Mapbox, Python Flask, and Claude AI for realistic scenario modeling.
